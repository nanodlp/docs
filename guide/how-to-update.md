## Automatic upgrade

Two release channels available stable and beta. Upon release of new stable version, you would get "New Version" sticker on NanoDLP navbar. 

By clicking on the sticker or going to *setup / tools page / upgrade* you can upgrade/downgrade your releases.

## Manual upgrade

You can use [advanced installation]({{< ref "installation#advanced-installation" >}}) method to upgrade your releases manually.
