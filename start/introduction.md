## Ecosystem

NanoDLP consists of different solutions for different purposes:

* NanoDLP
* NanoSupport
* NanoDLP official controller board

### NanoDLP

It is standalone all-in-one controller and host solution to slice and print 3D objects on SLA and SLS machines. It does provide web interface and could run on any platform (ARM, PC, Mac and etc). Considering its capabilities requirements to run it pretty low and majority of users running it on Raspberry Pi.

### NanoSupport

3D editor which could be used to put support on 3D objects before sending to the NanoDLP or any other controller. 

### NanoDLP official controller board

The [NanoDLP controller board](https://www.nano3dtech.com/nanodlp-controller-board/) support different hardwares needed in order to operate 3D printer.

## This document

NanoDLP documentation arranged in three different sections.

### Get started

This part focused with mostly getting familiar with basic concepts and commands needed in order to run NanoDLP on Raspberry Pi.

### User manual

You could find detailed description on all NanoDLP individual features.

### Guide

Here you could find guides on more advanced features or concepts needed to run and operate NanoDLP on different OSes with different hardwares.
