## Why use PCB printing?

One of the best way to make high resolution [PCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) (circuit board) is to use technique called [photoengraving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoengraving). Your SLA 3D printer easily could be used to print PCB board by using same technique.

The new dedicated feature for PCB printing on NanoDLP help you to print export of the PCB design in PNG and JPEG formats. It automatically fit the PCB and invert circuit board schema.

## How to use it?

Go to plates page and press PCB button to start defining a plate for PCB printing.
