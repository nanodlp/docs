## Sources

### Internal

Currently possible to see realtime flow of data from current sources:

* Slicer data
  * Solid Area
  * Area Count
  * Largest Area
* Current layer information
  * Cure time
  * Speed
  * Support or Normal layer

### External

External sources many sensors that could be read such as

* Moister
* Resin Level
* Driver Ampere
* Light Intensity
* Pressure
* Temperature

Currently common sensors and platforms already supported

* HX711
* OpenScale
* Serial Device Reading (Comma Separated)
