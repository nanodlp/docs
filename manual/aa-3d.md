## What is/are the reason(s) to use it?

Jagged edges occur due to undersampling. The cause of undersampling is because of having low resolution of the printer or loss of information in the picture. Enabling Anti-aliasing will solve this problem and smoothen transition between different layers.

## Why not use it?

It may not suitable for resin types and cause under-cured resin.

## How to use it?

Go to profile and enable 3D anti-aliasing
