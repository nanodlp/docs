## Why using it?

Using *adaptive layer thickness* use can increase print quality without sacrificing print time.

## How to use it?

To use adaptive layer thickness you need to enter minimum and maximum layer thickness based on your resin and machine properties on resin profile.

As layers with different thickness will require different cure times you also need to enable and use *Dynamic Cure-time* input on the resin profile page to define cure time based on layer thickness
